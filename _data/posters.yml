        All multicellular organisms evolved from unicellular ancestors, yet not all multicellular lineages evolved similar levels of complexity. The evolution of complex multicellularity involves a series of adaptations that transform simple groups of cells into large structures of differentiated cells. Experimental and theoretical studies have identified some key factors that influence the evolution of complexity such as the presence of bottlenecks in multicellular life cycles and whether development is clonal or aggregative. These factors, however, distinguish between disparate types of multicellular life cycles; yet little is known about how small variations within the same type of multicellular life cycle affect its future evolution. Here, we consider a simple multicellular life cycle of a filament that reproduces via fragmentation. We use mathematical modeling to explore how subtle variations in the fragmentation process affect the rate that beneficial mutations fix. In particular, we find that the number of daughter filaments produced during a fragmentation affects the speed and likelihood that mutations fix. One class of mutations, called altruistic mutations, that impose a cost on individual cells but improve the survival of the filament did not fix when filaments fragmented into high numbers of daughters. Our results show that the specific structure of a multicellular life cycle matters, either promoting or inhibiting adaptations that give rise to greater organismal complexity.

        Having access to Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) bioinformatic pipelines of Staphylococcus aureus (S. aureus) in a life-threatening condition such as sepsis reduce the turnaround time of diagnosis and aid in appropriate antibiotic therapy, but having a bioinformatician in each clinical microbiological laboratory is not feasible.A fully automated user-friendly software optimized for microbiologists without a background in bioinformatics facilitates the routine use.Paired-end sequences of 264 strains of S.aureus from patients with suspected sepsis were assembled and analyzed by an in-house pipeline using de novo assembly and commercial platform, 1928DSA. We compared the two strategies of the WGS method to the standard method of Matrix-assisted Laser Desorption Ionization Time of Flight Mass Spectrometry (MALDI-TOF MS) and disc diffusion, and were also compared with each other for multilocus sequence typing, species identification, virulence, and resistance profiling. The in-house pipeline identified a higher number of S. aureus species (99%) than 1928DSA (97%). Both methods identified the same non-S. aureus species, which were not recognized by MALDI-TOF MS. They were also consistent with MALDI-TOF MS in discovering MRSA strains. The genotypic antibiotic resistance prediction matched each other in the prediction of Erythromycin and Fusidic acid (100%) and Penicillin class resistance (85.8%). More results were attained by the in-house pipeline in terms of ST type prediction (96.5%) versus 1928DSA (91%). Both methods showed the same results for five virulence genes; LukF-PVL, LukS-PVL, etA, etB, and tst. Overall, according to our comparison, 1928DSA presented functionality for clinical use in identifying and prediction of non-S. aureus and MRSA strains, and resistance genes of Penicillin class and Erythromycin.

        Antimicrobial resistance poses a great danger to humanity, in part due to the widespread horizontal transfer of plasmids via conjugation. Modelling of plasmid transfer is essential to uncovering the fundamentals of resistance transfer and for development of predictive measures to limit the spread of resistance. However, a major limitation in the current understanding of plasmids is the inadequate characterisation of their DNA transfer mechanisms, such as the DNA origin-of-transfer regions, where plasmid transfer initiates. This conceals the actual potential for plasmid transfer in nature. Here, we consider that the plasmid-borne origin-of-transfer substrates encode specific DNA structural properties that can facilitate finding and typing these regions in large datasets, including determining their potential transfer ranges ([https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20157-y](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-018-20157-y)). We thus develop a DNA structure-based alignment procedure for typing the origin-of-transfer substrates that outperforms the current sequence-based approaches ([https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050401](https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.04.20.050401), [https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14922](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.14922)). We identify thousands of yet undiscovered putative DNA transfer substrates, showing that putative plasmid mobility can in fact be 2-fold higher and span almost 2-fold more host species than is currently understood. Over half of all putative mobile plasmids contain conjugative mechanisms belonging to different mobility groups, which can potentially link previously confined host ranges across ecological habitats into a robust plasmid transfer network. We show that this network can in fact serve to transfer antimicrobial resistance from the environmental genetic reservoirs to human pathogens, which might be an important driver of the observed rapid resistance development in humans and thus an important point of focus for future prevention measures.

        Genome-scale metabolic models (GEMs) are valuable tools to study metabolism and provide a scaffold for the integrative analysis of omics data. GEMs often encompass thousands of reactions, metabolites and genes, whose manipulation require complex data structures.
      - >
        Metabolic Atlas, through the web platform available at [https://metabolicatlas.org](https://metabolicatlas.org), aims to make the entire GEM content available for easy navigation. This is achieved through both tabular and map views (2D and 3D), each suited for different usage scenarios. In addition, Metabolic Atlas aims to meet the needs of the community through the development of specific tools and features though iterative releases.
      - >
        Currently, Metabolic Atlas facilitates exploration and visualization of two open-source GEMs: Human1, an integration and extensive curation of the most recent human metabolic models (Robinson et al., 2020), and Yeast8, a consensus metabolic model for S. cerevisiae (Lu et al., 2019).
      - >
        The history of Metabolic Atlas starts before 2015 (Pornputtapong et al., 2015). The present website has been re-developed from the ground up, following open-source standards. It was made publicly available mid 2019, and is now at version 1.7 (Robinson et al., 2020). We plan to continue the development in a tic-toc method: a major release altering the foundation of the website, followed by several smaller releases. We are actively engaging the community to address the challenges in accessing GEMs for curation, analysis and biological understanding, under the guidance of FAIR principles.

        The endosymbiotic event that gave rise to mitochondria and eukaryotes is a pivotal event in the evolution of life on earth— unparalleled in terms of its rarity and significance. It is thought to have occurred only once and account for the evolution of all large, complex life. Despite its importance, we do not understand the general principles that govern the probability of an endosymbiotic event. To this end, we use scaling relationships that connect requirements of microbial physiology to microbial size in order to investigate for what organismal sizes of endosymbiont and host an endosymbiosis would be physically possible. By studying these scaling relationships, we hope to obtain a null hypothesis of feasible and likely scenarios for a successful endosymbiosis.

        Lipolysis and the release of fatty acids to supply energy to other organs, e.g. during exercise and starvation, are important functions of the adipose tissue. The intracellular lipolytic pathway of adipocytes is activated by adrenaline and noradrenaline, and inhibited by insulin. Type 2 diabetic individuals have elevated levels of circulating fatty acids. The mechanism behind this elevation is not fully known, and to increase the knowledge, a link between the systemic circulation and intracellular lipolysis is key. However, lipolysis data and knowledge from in vitro systems has not been linked to corresponding data and knowledge in vivo. Here, we use mathematical modeling to provide such a link. We combine mechanisms for insulin effects found from in vivo and in vitro data into a model that can explain all data. The model is also tested on independent data. We show the usefulness of the model by simulating new and more challenging experimental setups in silico, e.g. the release of fatty acids into the circulation during an insulin clamp, and the difference in such simulations between individuals with and without type 2 diabetes. Our work provides a new platform for model-based analysis of fatty acid release from the adipose tissue, in health and disease.

        Atherosclerosis develops over several years and usually does not show symptoms before it leads to more acute conditions such as stroke. In order to prevent and predict a stroke, the mechanisms behind atherosclerosis must therefore be fully understood. These mechanisms function as a system on different levels, comprising many both medical and environmental factors, and involving multiple organs, timescales, and control mechanisms. There are also different types of data available, relevant for prediction and treatment of atherosclerosis: clinical and images, population and individual data, dynamic and static. Therefore, a multiscale, multilevel as well as a hybrid modelling approach is needed to fully understand and predict the disease progression of atherosclerosis. Herein, we propose a multi-level model for atherosclerosis progression, connecting diabetes progression, on cellular up to organ and whole-body level, with models for long-term effects of triglycerides in blood and inflammation. This mechanistic model can be used to simulate biomarkers over time for different interventions (i.e drug or diet), to be feeded into a machine learning model for stroke risk calculation. We think our suggested hybrid model could be used as decision support, in the clinic or by individuals themselves, to evaluate different treatments and interventions, whilst offering a way to understand why a certain prediction was made, from a physiological perspective, and thus criticize the assessments made.

        Changes in gene expression levels between different conditions are mainly caused by changes in transcription factor binding. Using newer methods to map transcription factor binding with unprecedented resolution, like ChIP-exo, one can obtain in-depth knowledge about transcription factor behavior at different conditions. Combining accurate binding maps with accurate expression measurements one can gain insights into how differential transcription factor binding affects conditional gene expression patterns. This knowledge can subsequently be leveraged to rationally modify promoters to achieve a desired conditional gene expression response, which is desirable in metabolic engineering. Using data from 21 transcription factors in the model organism Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we built a machine learning model to identify the most important determinants for conditional gene expression. We also present an online promoter engineering tool called HYENA. With HYENA one can design hybrid promoters with defined conditional gene expression responses for yeast cells grown on glucose and on ethanol. This tool is based on gradient boosting regression trees and is equipped with a user-friendly streamlit based interface.

        Hypertension is one of the most common health issues today with 25% men affected worldwide, and is twice as common in patients with type 2 diabetes (T2D). Hypertension is defined in Europe as a blood pressure of ≥140/≥90 mmHg and uncontrolled hypertension is a risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as coronary artery disease, heart failure, and renal failure. The basic underlying mechanisms such as a dysregulated renin-angiotensin system, alterations in chemo- and baroreceptors and disturbed sodium-potassium balance are known. However, the connection to other cardiovascular diseases is complex and the treatment of hypertension usually involves lifestyle changes and trial- and error by testing several anti-hypertensive drugs . There is a need of deeper understanding of the changes in hemodynamics during hypertension and especially in T2D patients. Non-invasive measurements such as four-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging (4D Flow MRI) allows for detailed data on hemodynamics with 3D visualization of blood flow over time. By combining this hemodynamic data with a cardiovascular lumped parameter model, more information can be extracted that otherwise is hard to measure non-invasively, such as parameters of the contraction and relaxation of the left ventricle and the propagation of the pressure wave . Through a sub-study to SCAPIS Linköping, 40 T2D patients and 44 controls underwent 4D Flow MRI and cuff pressure measurements. A cardiovascular model is now being applied to the data, to create personalized models with hemodynamics for each individual. This gives assessment of new model-derived biomarkers, which are compared between hypertensive and non-hypertensive individuals, as well as between T2D patients and controls, to investigate hemodynamic differences between and within the groups. The study has the potential to bring new insights to the hemodynamic mechanisms behind hypertension with and without T2D, and to provide a new clinical tool for diagnostics.
