    Matteo has recently become professor at the University of Surrey and has a
    background in industrial biochemistry, molecular biology and computational
    modelling. His research focuses on integrating experimentation and
    computation to gain insight on cellular organization. His main areas of
    focus are temporal control of gene regulation of cell cycle control and
    multi-scale frameworks that integrate cellular regulation.
  title: Systems biology to decipher design principles of cellular networks
  abstract: >
    Continuity of life is sustained by time-dependent responses of biological
    networks that are associated to oscillatory behavior of their components,
    at a proper frequency. The eukaryotic cell cycle is such an example, with
    waves of enzymatic activities being tightly regulated to guarantee its
    frequency. Therefore, molecular designs that exhibit a proper frequency of
    enzymatic oscillations are inherently crucial for a timely cell cycle
    progression. In this talk, I will show how computational frameworks, such
    as kinetic modelling, Boolean modelling, and multi-scale modelling, may
    serve the purpose of investigating how a timely cell cycle progression is
    achieved, possibly resulting in the identification of novel principle of
    design that ensures a timely cell cycling
