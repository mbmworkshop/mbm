     Gunnar Cedersund heads the Integrative Systems Biology group at Linköping University
     ([isbgroup.eu](http://isbgroup.eu)). The ~15 people working in this group collaborate
     with a large number of clinical, experimental, and psychological research groups, 
     to do modelling of all of the main organs in the human body: the brain, heart, 
     fat and muscle, liver, pancreas, vasculature, etc. Together these organ models are 
     combined into a multi-level and multi-timescale digital twin technology, which was 
     launched at Almedalen last year, and which has since been presented at keynote 
     presentations at conferences such as NIH, IT i vården, ModProd, etc. Cedersund has 
     also started a new spin-off company, SUND, to help bring the digital twin technology
     into end-usage in pharma, healthcare, research, and in the life of ordinary people.
     Apart from this, Cedersund is also a concert pianist, a yoga and dance teacher, and
     an ironman. He is now working on bringing all of these aspects together into joint
     lectures/performances, where digital twins are both presented from a technological
     and medical point-of-view, and then dancing together with professional dancers to
     illustrate the music that is being played by Cedersund.

    Andreas Hellander is Associate Professor in Scientific Computing at Uppsala University
    where he leads a research group that studys how to design highly scalable, robust and
    intelligent computational tools for digital experiments. A core focus area has been
    discrete stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks, where he has contributed
    with both theory for mesoscopic chemical kinetics, new multiscale methods, and software,
    for example as co-PI in the StochSS project. A central motivation for current activities
    in the lab is how traditional model analysis approaches fail when models are stochastic
    and high-dimensional and when they involve processes at widely disparate temporal and
    spatial scales. Systems biology is an area where all these challenges become apparent,
    and many of the current projects in the lab revolve around machine learning assisted
    approaches for black-box model exploration and model inference. A central aim there is
    development of intelligent, interactive systems capable of automating model analysis
    tasks.
