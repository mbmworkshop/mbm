        Gunnar Cedersund heads the Integrative Systems Biology group at Linköping University ([isbgroup.eu](http://isbgroup.eu)).
    - >
        The ~15 people working in this group collaborate with a large number of clinical, experimental, and psychological research groups, to do modelling of all of the main organs in the human body: the brain, heart, fat and muscle, liver, pancreas, vasculature, etc. Together these organ models are combined into a multi-level and multi-timescale digital twin technology, which was launched at Almedalen last year, and which has since been presented at keynote presentations at conferences such as NIH, IT i vården, ModProd, etc. Cedersund has also started a new spin-off company, SUND, to help bring the digital twin technology into end-usage in pharma, healthcare, research, and in the life of ordinary people.

        Apart from this, Cedersund is also a concert pianist, a yoga and dance teacher, and an ironman. He is now working on bringing all of these aspects together into joint lectures/performances, where digital twins are both presented from a technological and medical point-of-view, and then dancing together with professional dancers to illustrate the music that is being played by Cedersund.

        Andreas Hellander is Associate Professor in Scientific Computing at Uppsala University where he leads a research group that studys how to design highly scalable, robust and intelligent computational tools for digital experiments.
    - >
        A core focus area has been discrete stochastic simulation of gene regulatory networks, where he has contributed with both theory for mesoscopic chemical kinetics, new multiscale methods, and software, for example as co-PI in the StochSS project. A central motivation for current activities in the lab is how traditional model analysis approaches fail when models are stochastic and high-dimensional and when they involve processes at widely disparate temporal and spatial scales. Systems biology is an area where all these challenges become apparent, and many of the current projects in the lab revolve around machine learning assisted approaches for black-box model exploration and model inference. A central aim there is development of intelligent, interactive systems capable of automating model analysis tasks.

        Lars Rönnegård is a professor in Statistics at Dalarna University and researcher at SLU, Uppsala.
    - >
        An important goal for him is to find simple statistical solutions to complex problems. A majority of his publications are in the field of statistical genetics, but he has also developed a widely used statistical package in R, hglm, and coauthored an accompanying textbook.
    - >
        He is a Beijer Researcher at SLU since 2019 and coordinator of research projects investigating social interactions of dairy cattle together with collaborators from SLU, RISE, Dalarna University and University of Copenhagen. A primary component of this research is the use of a real time location system to study the indoor movement and social interactions of dairy cattle. The possibility to select for increased milk yield considering effects of social interactions are investigated by developing theory on indirect genetic effects. The aim is to increase both production and welfare.
