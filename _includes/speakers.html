    <p class="text-muted">
      Assistant Professor and Scientific Researcher at the University of Amsterdam and VU University Amsterdam
    </p>
    <p>
      Matteo is Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam and has a background in 
      industrial biochemistry, molecular biology and computational modelling. 
      His research focuses on integrating experimentation and computation to gain 
      insight on cellular organization. 
      His main areas of focus are temporal control of gene regulation 
      of cell cycle control and multi-scale frameworks that integrate cellular regulation.

    <h2>Francesco Gatto</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Guest Researcher at Chalmers and Co-Founder + Chief Scientific Officer at <a href="https://elypta.com" target="_blank">Elypta</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Named Winner of MIT Technology Review's <em>Innovators Under 35</em> in 2018, Francesco co-founded Elypta in 2017, a molecular diagnostics start-up 
      focussed to improve the survival outlook of cancer patients by developing 
      systems biology-driven biomarkers.
      He invented a diagnostic and prognostic test for renal cell carcinoma based on 
      an exceptionally accurate liquid biopsy, which leveraged on a novel systems 
      biomarker for this common form of kidney cancer.
      This test recently showed unprecedented potential for other cancer types.

    <h2>Peter Gennemark</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      PhD in Computing Science specialising in Systems Biology and Senior Research Scientist at <a href="https://www.astrazeneca.com/our-science/gothenburg.html" target="_blank">AstraZeneca R&amp;D</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Peter is working with mathematical modelling of biological systems and their interactions with drugs (systems biology and PK/PD). In particular, body composition modelling.
      In particular, this involves computational and applied mathematical aspects of mathematical modelling such as identification, experimental planning, and data integration. He has been involved in the development of multiple software applications, concerning experimental design for preclinical applications (PopED lite), identification of ordinary differential equations (<a href="www.odeidentification.org" target="_blank">www.odeidentification.org</a>), and accelerated analysis of preclinical PK/PD data (a Matlab library).

    <h2>Adil Mardinoglu</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Associate Professor and group leader at <a href="http://sysmedicine.com/" target="_blank">Sysmedicine, SciLifeLab</a>
    </p>
    <p>
      Adil is an expert in the field of Systems Biology and Bioinformatics. His recent research activities include the generation of the context specific genome-scale metabolic models for healthy human cell-types e.g. adipocytes, hepatocytes and myocytes as well as certain types of cancer e.g. liver cancer. He employed the reconstructed comprehensive models for revealing the molecular mechanisms of obesity associated diseases as well as for discovery of the novel biomarkers and drug targets. He also reconstructed personalized and population based models for liver cancer patients in order to identify anticancer drug targets that can inhibit the growth of, or kill tumors.
