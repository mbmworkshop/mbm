    <p>
      Matteo is Assistant Professor at the University of Amsterdam and has a background in 
      industrial biochemistry, molecular biology and computational modelling. 
      His research focuses on integrating experimentation and computation to gain 
      insight on cellular organization. 
      His main areas of focus are temporal control of gene regulation 
      of cell cycle control and multi-scale frameworks that integrate cellular regulation.

    <h2>Francesco Gatto</h2>
    <p class="text-muted">
      Guest Researcher at Chalmers and Co-Founder + Chief Scientific Officer at Elypta
    </p>
    <p>
      Named Winner of MIT Technology Review's <em>Innovators Under 35</em> in 2018, Francesco co-founded Elypta in 2017, a molecular diagnostics start-up 
      focussed to improve the survival outlook of cancer patients by developing 
      systems biology-driven biomarkers.
      He invented a diagnostic and prognostic test for renal cell carcinoma based on 
      an exceptionally accurate liquid biopsy, which leveraged on a novel systems 
      biomarker for this common form of kidney cancer.
      This test recently showed unprecedented potential for other cancer types.
