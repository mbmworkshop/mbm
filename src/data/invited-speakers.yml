    - >
      The research in the Nordling Lab is divided into two themes--AI & Data Science and Systems & Synthetic Biology. Within AI & Data Science, their projects cover questions within Digital health, Industry 4.0, Internet of things, and Robotics. Within Systems & Synthetic Biology, the research group focuses on Biomarker discovery, Experiment design, and Identification of gene regulatory networks. The core is a data centric approach to all problems applying existing or developing new methodology as needed.

    Jan Hasenauer is a professor for computational biomedicine and leads the Interdisciplinary Research Unit Mathematics and Life Sciences at the University of Bonn and the Research Group for Data-driven Computational Modelling at the Helmholtz Zentrum München.   
  bio:
    - >
      The group of Jan Hasenauer consists of eleven PhD students and seven PostDocs, and his research focuses on the development of methods for data-driven modelling of biological processes. These methods enable model-based integration of different data sets, critical evaluation of available information, comparison of different biological hypotheses and tailor-made selection of future experiments. In various national and international collaborations these methods are currently employed to address research questions in molecular biology, immunology, neurobiology and epidemiology.

   Maria Kjellsson is an associate professor at the Dept. of Pharmacy at Uppsala University, and leads, together with Mats Karlsson, the research focused on diabetes and associated diseases, performed in the Pharmacometrics group. 
  bio: 
    - >
      The group use mixed-effects models to investigate several complex aspects of diabetes, from pre-clinical experiments to treatment, risk factors, and disease progression of diabetes. The model applications range from drug discovery and drug development to predictions of long-term treatment effects and risk of cardiovascular disease. Currently, Kjellsson is project leader of a Swedish Research Council-sponsored project with the aim to develop a tool to visualize patients' risk of cardiovascular disease and how the risk changes with treatments.
