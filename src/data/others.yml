        The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted the shortcomings of epidemiological modelling for guiding policy decisions. Current models depend on unreliable population statistics and ad hoc parameters due to the lack of public data on the spread of infection in contact networks and individual disease journeys. My aim is to replace population statistics with data from individual disease journeys for fast policy support with iteratively improving accuracy in future pandemics. In this talk, I will highlight specific needs, constraints, opportunities, and results from our ongoing work. I will also compare the evolution of the pandemic in Sweden and Taiwan and forecast the end of the current community outbreak.

#         Type 2 diabetes is an important risk factor for myocardial infarction and stroke, which are the leading causes of death in the world. Central to these diseases is the adipose tissue. The adipose tissue is both responding to hormones like insulin and catecholamines, which regulate the metabolic function of the tissue, and is secreting its own hormones, e.g. adiponectin. However, even if much research has generated many partial insights regarding these processes, there is still a lack of consensus regarding many details. The main reason for this is the high degree of complexity and over-lapping co-regulation between the different processes. To tackle this complexity, we have collected highly resolved quantitative data, which we have analyzed using mechanistic modelling. This combination has allowed us to iteratively test and refine mechanistic hypotheses, where we use the data to both evaluate and refine the hypotheses, and to validate them using independent predictions. We have used this approach to characterize various sub-systems in the adipose tissue: insulin signaling leading to glucose uptake and inhibition of lipolysis, catecholamine stimulation of lipolysis and adiponectin secretion, both in type 2 diabetes and control. These models have so far described these processes one by one, even though there are important points of overlap. In this talk I will present both our results for the different existing models, and outline how we now are creating a combined multi-level model for the adipose tissue. This final model will be able to serve as a module in whole-body models used to aid drug development and healthcare.

#         All multicellular organisms evolved from unicellular ancestors, yet not all multicellular lineages evolved similar levels of complexity. The evolution of complex multicellularity involves a series of adaptations that transform simple groups of cells into large structures of differentiated cells. Experimental and theoretical studies have identified some key factors that influence the evolution of complexity such as the presence of bottlenecks in multicellular life cycles and whether development is clonal or aggregative. These factors, however, distinguish between disparate types of multicellular life cycles; yet little is known about how small variations within the same type of multicellular life cycle affect its future evolution. Here, we consider a simple multicellular life cycle of a filament that reproduces via fragmentation. We use mathematical modeling to explore how subtle variations in the fragmentation process affect the rate that beneficial mutations fix. In particular, we find that the number of daughter filaments produced during a fragmentation affects the speed and likelihood that mutations fix. One class of mutations, called altruistic mutations, that impose a cost on individual cells but improve the survival of the filament did not fix when filaments fragmented into high numbers of daughters. Our results show that the specific structure of a multicellular life cycle matters, either promoting or inhibiting adaptations that give rise to greater organismal complexity.

#         Polycomb proteins are critical epigenetic regulators of metazoan development. They form two major kinds of complexes, Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2). PRC2 can add up to three methyl groups to Lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27), which is necessary for its repressive function. PRC2 functions in two ways: hit-&-run, a diffusion based random methylation of the inactive genome, and by targeting to specific genes. When PRC2 targets  genes it binds to genomic elements called Polycomb Response Elements (PREs).

#         We model the dynamics of epigenetic repression by PRC2 in replicating Drosophila melanogaster cells. To this effect, we represent chromatin as a string of nucleosomes, each with 2 methylation sites, which can have 0-3 methyl groups attached. Using experimental bulk values for the methylation states, measured difference in methylation rates for adding the first, second or third methylation group, and allosteric stimulation, we constrain the model to represent hit-&-run methylation. By introducing additional parameters: an increase in catalytic efficiency when PRC2 is bound to a PRE, and the probability of interaction with the PRE-bound PRC2 we further expand the model to represent targeted methylation.
#       - >
#         In the current state, the model recapitulates H3K27me3 profiles around known Polycomb regulated genes and sets the framework to answer questions that cannot be addressed by experiments alone. For example, how the H3K27 methylation profiles build up during fly development and the purpose of allosteric stimulation, and so on.
