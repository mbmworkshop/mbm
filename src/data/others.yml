    title: Evolving teams and their Nash equilibria
    abstract:
      - >
        Using the adaptive dynamics framework, the evolution of organisms that compete for survival can be studied theoretically. We have combined adaptive dynamics with game theory in the sense of Menden-Deuer and Rowlett (2019). The game simulates replicating organisms and differentiates individuals such that each species is a game-theoretical player but competition for survival is happening at the individual level.

    title: Proteomics profiling reveals biomarkers for predicting diagnosis, disease activity and long-term disability outcome in multiple sclerosis
    abstract:
      - >
        To personalize multiple sclerosis (MS) treatment strategies, sensitive and reliable protein biomarkers are needed to predict disease trajectory. We used protein profiling based on the highly sensitive proximity extension assay combined with next generation sequencing (Olink Explore) to measure 1463 proteins in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and plasma from 143 people with early-stage MS and 43 healthy controls. With longitudinally followed discovery and replication cohorts we identified CSF proteins that consistently predicted both short- and long-term disease progression. Neurofilament light chain (NfL) in CSF was confirmed as superior for predicting the absence of disease activity 2 years after sampling (replication AUC = 0.77). Importantly, we also identified a combination of 11 CSF proteins (CXCL13, LTA, FCN2, ICAM3, LY9, SLAMF7, TYMP, CHI3L1, FYB1, TNFRSF1B, NfL) that could predict the severity of disability worsening according to the normalized age-related MS severity score (replication AUC = 0.90). Identified proteins elucidate pathogenetic processes and can aid decisions of treatment strategies for people with MS.

    title: A Physiological-Twin for Alcohol Consumption – Connecting short-term drinking habits to plasma PEth
    abstract:
      - >
        Recreational use of alcohol is responsible for a wide variety of preventable health complications, such as alcoholic fatty liver disease, and is still a major mortality risk factor in the age group 15-47. The effect of alcohol consumption has high inter-person variability, depending on several different factors such as sex, weight and height. Informing and educating individuals thus allowing them to make informed personalized decisions, might be effective in reducing dangerous drinking habits. We are currently establishing a modeling based personalizable digital twin framework describing short-term plasma ethanol dynamics and long-term alcohol consumption clinical markers such as phosphatidyl ethanol (PEth). The digital twin model can guide the user on the effects of consuming alcoholic beverages, including in combination with non-alcoholic beverages and meals, and it can illustrate the effect of short-term drinking on long-term alcohol use biomarkers in the body.

    title: Connecting the Neurovascular coupling and Electrophysiological signaling – a modeling approach
    abstract:
      - >
        The brain is a vital organ with great structural complexity, consisting of some 100 billion neurons and glial cells. This complexity makes it difficult to isolate the origins of different functionalities in the brain. It is also challenging to explore which and how irregularities cause diseases. To overcome the structural complexity, mathematical modeling has been used to explore how key aspects of the brain can be explained. Two such key aspects are the electrical signaling of neuron populations and neurovascular coupling (NVC). The NVC is the mechanism that allows neurons to regulate the control of cerebral blood flow to meet the metabolic demand. While the electrical signaling is the framework for cognitive function and communication between neurons. Together, the NVC and electrical signaling are two key processes that generate the functionality of the brain.
      - >
        The NVC is initiated by electrical activity - that causes influxes of different ions into the neurons. These ions drive the synthesis of vasoactive substances that regulate the blood vessels and these blood flow changes increase/decrease the supply of glucose and oxygen. The availability of these metabolites is essential for the energy-demanding ion transportation that is the foundation for the electrical activity generated by the neurons. These two processes are thus highly dependent on each other. 
      - >
        Despite this interdependence, most mathematical models only include one of these processes. In this work, we aim to create a mathematical model that combines the NVC and the electrical signaling into one framework. This combination will be achieved by integrating the logic of the neuronal excretion of vasoactive substances into a spiking neural network, allowing the NVC coupling to be controlled by electrical firing. This model will allow us to create a framework where a spatially resolved model of the brain, through the NVC, can control the blood vessels to satisfy the metabolic demand. As the model includes the NVC, a supply of metabolites, and the consumption of metabolites to generate electrical activity – this model is a needed addition in our efforts to establish a model framework of the brain. 
      - >
        With this framework established, the model would allow for more realistic predictions. The spatially resolved nature of the model allows us to investigate how alteration of the electrical signaling could cause different diseases. Furthermore, as the NVC is integrated into the model – more knowledge can be integrated as this allows us to bridge the gap between electrophysiological measurements and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)-based measurements.

    title: Complementing MPS with mechanistic computer models help overcome limitations - translating the drug exenatide from MPS to humans
    abstract:
      - >
        Today, realistic organoids can be combined into microphysiological systems (MPS), which are useful for a growing list of applications. Because of this combination, one can study dynamic cross-talk between organs, otherwise only observable in animals. This improved realism creates the potential to replace animal experiments, improve drug development, etc. However, using a purely experimental approach, there are certain limitations that are hard to overcome: the dynamic cross-talk makes data interpretation difficult, and today’s MPS still display critical differences to humans, in terms of functionality, volume differences, and missing organs. We therefore propose to combine MPS with mechanistic computer models, which can help overcome these short-comings.  
      - >
        In this presentation, we demonstrate this potential for our two-organ MPS, with liver spheroids and pancreas organ model. Using this MPS, we can study central metabolism, in both healthy conditions and disease states, such as type 2 diabetes and liver steatosis. We develop the computer model by mechanistic hypothesis testing, and validate the model by comparing experiments first done in the computer with subsequent MPS results. Using the validated computer model, we can also create more human-like versions of the MPS system. We can, for instance, scale the volumes of the organoids and the circulating media to the human proportions; this makes the consumption of a glucose tolerance test go from the unrealistic 48h to the typical human timescale of 2-4h. We can also add already developed computer models for the missing organs – muscle, fat, brain, etc. We demonstrate how this assembling into a human model can translate MPS results for a specific drug: exenatide. 
      - >
        In summary, our integrated experimental-computational approach overcomes some of the inherent limitations of MPS, and could help lay the basis for a new type of knowledge-driven drug development.

    title: Elevated blood stasis in patients with atrial fibrillation computed with computational fluid dynamics 
    abstract:
      - >
        In patients with atrial fibrillation (AF), the risk for stroke is increased. The underlaying relation between AF and stroke is not fully understood. It has been believed that during phases of active fibrillation, velocities in the left atrium (LA) are reduced, leading to thrombus formation. However, in recent years it has been debated that atrial cardiomyopathy, a disease of the atrial wall, could cause both AF and stroke. The aim of this study was to investigate atrial blood flow and function in controls and AF patients during sinus rhythm to better understand the correlation between blood stasis and atrial contraction.  
      - >
        Time-resolved computed tomography (CT) data, covering the whole heart in 20 timeframes, were acquired in 21 AF patients with paroxysmal AF in sinus rhythm. For each of the 21 patients, the atrial and ventricular blood pool were segmented and tracked over the cardiac cycle. These were imposed as a boundary condition for the computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation conducted using Ansys Fluent. The mesh contained approximately 8 million cells and the simulation time step was 0.5 ms. To quantify the risk of stasis, the blood residence time, an indicator for the time the blood has spent in the left heart, was computed together with functional data such as atrial volume. 
      - >
        We found large differences in atrial blood residence time between patients and controls (p<0.001) and a strong correlation between reduced LA ejection fraction and increased average residence time in the LA (R2=0.68, p<0.001).  
      - >
        In conclusion, atrial wall motion is coupled to cardiac flow dynamics and plays an important role when investigating stasis in the LA. Stasis is already increased in AF patients while in sinus rhythm. This shows that the risk for stroke might not only be elevated in phases of fibrillations, but also during sinus rhythm. In the future, parameters based on the cardiac motion and blood residence time could support stroke risk assessment in AF patients.

    title: From networks to neural networks - Systems-based approaches to immune-mediated inflammatory diseases using DNA methylation data
    abstract:
      - >
        Precision medicine relies on the identification of robust disease and risk factor signatures from omics data. Knowledge-driven techniques for biomarker discovery by us and others often utilize colocalization of disease genes in disease modules. However, these approaches may miss novel or unexpected phenomena since they rely on the quality of the available molecular interaction networks, which are known to be partially incomplete and affected by research biases. In this context, novel data-driven methodologies centered around deep artificial neural networks (DNNs) have begun to consolidate. Autoencoders (AEs) are a type of unsupervised DNN that reconstructs its input in its output, after reducing its dimensionality. Here, we hypothesized that the emergent encoding of deep AEs trained on large omics repositories, including hundreds of thousands of samples, could encompass complex non-linear relationships of biological relevance. Thus, we explored the architecture space of deep AEs trained on a pan-tissue compendium of human epigenome-wide association studies. To ensure our selected representation prioritized genes within functional modules, we tested for co-localization patterns in protein-protein networks to constrain the hyperparameters of the AEs. We then used the trained AEs to discover candidate disease genes by applying transfer learning to use the latent variables as robust features for problem-specific supervised learning tasks, achieving similar or superior performance than alternative classifiers. In summary, we believe our approach represents a significant improvement over traditional techniques by providing a more comprehensive and unbiased workflow for the analysis of omics data in the context of systems medicine.
